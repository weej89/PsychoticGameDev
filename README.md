Psychotic Horror Game Development for Unity
</h2>

<b>
Focus:
</b>
The focus of this game is to present AI in a horror scenario that will draw the player into the experience moreso than a
few simple jump scares would.  By placing the AI as the villain or adversary in such a situation we beleive that the player
will become more immersed in gameplay and therefore have an enhanced sensation of fear when coming face to face with a seemingly
smart and deadly opponent who is trying to kill and/or scare the crap out of them.  It should also be noted that this is for
a school project so the overall scope of the game will remain very small and self contained.  There will only be one level to 
showcase our AI's behavioral and pathfinding skills, so the goal is to optimize these to the fullest in the short amount of time
that we have (2 and a half months).  Afterwards there is a good chance that this will be expanded upon moreso in the future
with possible Oculus Rift support and enhanced AI techniques added.

<b>
Gameplay:
</b>
The gameplay should revolve around leaving the player in a helpless situation whos only option is to make it from point A to 
point B to escape from a crazed maniac stalking him through some abandoned apartments.  To emphasize this feeling of helplessness
the player will have only a simple flashlight that will gradually run out of batteries the more he uses it.  The only option for
surviving this game is to actively seek hiding spots throughout the level upon hearing or seeing the enemy approach you.
The overall game environment will be contained within an abandoned apartment complex fill with small dark claustrophobic spaces.
The player will have a small amount of regenerating health should he make it through an encounter with the enemy and manage to 
escape.  Hiding spaces may be interactable objects like closets, hidden rooms, or overturned props throughout the level.
